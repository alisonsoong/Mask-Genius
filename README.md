###### 1) App Name:
Mask Genius

###### 2) Keywords:
masks, mask, health, COVID-19, safety, education, information, game

###### 3) Description:
Mask Genius is an interactive way to learn about how masks protect us from COVID-19. This high school student built app includes a game, interactive animations, and tips to keep yourself safe during the pandemic.

FEATURES OVERVIEW
- Game: pick a mask to wear in five different situations and beat your high score!
- Interactive animations to compare the filtration efficiency of three different masks: an N95 mask, a surgical mask, and a cotton mask.
- Compilation of research-backed data on mask filtration efficiency.
- Other tips on how to stay safe!

GAME
- Promotes the use of masks in everyday life.
- Takes users through realistic situations, such as buying restaurant takeout.
- In each situation, there are options to wear an N95 mask, a surgical mask, a cotton mask, or no mask.
- Users can gain points by putting themselves at lower risk for exposure. 
- Every situation has a “risk factor” which reflects the score of a round (higher risk means a lower score). 
- The risk factor is calculated based on two pieces of information: what kind of mask is used and the situation’s general risk.
- Mask filtration efficiency data (used to calculate the risk factor) came from a research paper published by the American Chemical Society. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252 
- Each situation’s general risk was based on a scale created by the Texas Medical Association that quantifies the risk level of daily activities. https://www.texmed.org/TexasMedicineDetail.aspx?id=54216 

ANIMATION
- Interactive animations that depict particles getting blocked by or passing through three different masks.
- Shows the effectiveness of each mask at filtering out different sized particles.
- Choose which mask is being simulated (Choices include an N95, a surgical mask, and a cotton mask)
- Put a mask up to the test against aerosol, droplets, or both particle sizes at the same time.
- Mask filtration efficiency data (used to calculate the risk factor) came from a research paper published by the American Chemical Society. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252 

LEARN
- Descriptions of the filtration efficiencies of N95, surgical, cotton, and hybrid masks. 
- Information on their effectiveness against different sized particles (aerosol versus droplets).
- Apply what you have learned to your daily life, and be an upstanding member of your community!

This app is inspired by an article published by the American Chemical Society. Data about the filtration efficiencies of the four different masks (N95, surgical, cotton, and hybrid) are from this source.
